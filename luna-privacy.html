    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal identification information (PII) unless you voluntarily provide it. Any data

    <h2>2. App Store Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions are handled securely by Apple via the App Store. We do not have access to your credit

        to generate your results. We do not sell your data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can manage or delete your data directly within the app settings. Since we do not track individual users via
