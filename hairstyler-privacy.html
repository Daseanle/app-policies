    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 2, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>AI Hairstyle Master</strong>. Your privacy is critically important to us. This policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number. The app operates mainly on your local device or via secure, temporary API connections.</p>

    <h2>2. Photo Processing</h2>
    <p>Our app allows you to upload photos to try on different hairstyles using AI.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Where possible, images are processed on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Processing:</strong> If cloud-based AI is used, your photos are transmitted via encrypted HTTPS channels. We do not store your original photos on our servers beyond the time necessary to generate the result (typically under 5 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> All uploaded photos are automatically deleted from our processing servers immediately after the AI generation task is completed.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data during transmission. We do not sell or share any of your imagery with third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions are handled securely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your credit card or billing information.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: support@kunlungrowth.com</p>
