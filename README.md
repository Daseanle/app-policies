## How to Publish (Free via GitHub Pages)

1.  **Create a Repository:**
    *   Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository (e.g., named `healthstack-support`).
    *   Select "Public".
    *   Do not initialize with README (since you have these files).

2.  **Upload Files:**
    *   You can upload the files in this folder (`privacy.html`, `support.html`) directly via the GitHub web interface ("Add file" -> "Upload files").
    *   OR use git commands if you are familiar with terminal.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your repository **Settings** tab.
    *   Click **Pages** in the left sidebar.
    *   Under **Build and deployment**, select **Source** as `Deploy from a branch`.
    *   Select `main` (or `master`) branch and `/ (root)` folder.
    *   Click **Save**.

4.  **Get Your Links:**
    After about 1-2 minutes, your site will be live. Your URLs will be:

    *   **Privacy Policy URL:** `https://[YourUsername].github.io/[RepoName]/privacy.html`
    *   **Support URL:** `https://[YourUsername].github.io/[RepoName]/support.html`

    *Replace [YourUsername] and [RepoName] with your actual GitHub username and repository name.*
